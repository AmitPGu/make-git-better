## Directions

- Have fun :)
- Don't look at any hidden files or directories in this repo (unless you're directed to do so). **Specifically, don't look at the `.travis` or `.management` directories or the `.travis.yml` file. THIS WILL RUIN THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU.**
- This challenge will not require brute-forcing to solve - the solution, once you got it, should be clear.
- You are encourged to use any tool to solve the challenge. However, CLI is preferred to make sure you understand all the commands - save the GUI for day-to-day work.

## Reference materials
  
For how to use a specific command you always have `git help`. For a good explanation of concepts, [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the place to go.

> S^!t. HERNAME was kidnapped by Clu and I can't find her. We must get HERNAME back if you want to release me from the Grid; The key to `ENCOM/gridlock.sh` is hidden in her genetic code. Only if she will be in `ENCOM/HERNAME.iso` with the correct code, the gridlock will release and we could continue forward.

>    HERNAME: Sam, I was taken to a different repository altogether! Merge me back! The repo is https://github.com/EncomEnterprises/make-git-better. You'll have to merge changes from the same branch on the remote. 

_Note: no need to edit files in this stage, only git commands will suffice._
