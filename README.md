## Directions

- Have fun :)
- Don't look at any hidden files or directories in this repo (unless you're directed to do so). **Specifically, don't look at the `.travis` or `.management` directories or the `.travis.yml` file. THIS WILL RUIN THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU.**
- This challenge will not require brute-forcing to solve - the solution, once you got it, should be clear.
- You are encourged to use any tool to solve the challenge. However, CLI is preferred to make sure you understand all the commands - save the GUI for day-to-day work.

## Reference materials
  
For how to use a specific command you always have `git help`. For a good explanation of concepts, [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the place to go.

> `Oh, I see you've successfully logged in. Welcome to my club - the *End of Line* club! Please enjoy a drink. My name is Castor, the owner of this club. For the right price, I can point you in the right direction... ðŸ˜‰`

> `However, some branches in this network are watched by ENCOM. I won't tell you the flag when talking in these branches... But I'll tell you everything else you need to know.`

> Good work, Sam! You've logged into the system, and Clu is off our track... For now.
>
> Now you have to convince Castor to reveal where's the next step. All we need is for the `ENCOM/convince_castor.sh` script to offer the right price. The problem with Castor is that he's very fickle. He likes to _revert_ his opinion all the time. You'll have to see what he tells you to do...
>
> In this scenario, you can think of `sealed-updrink-kashyapa` as our `master` branch, and `sylvanly-narrower-oxboy` as our `dev` branch. We'll have to make and test our changes (according to Castor's requests) on the `dev` branch (meaning the `sylvanly-narrower-oxboy` branch), but at some point we'll have to "release" our changes to the `master` branch (meaning the `sealed-updrink-kashyapa` branch). Otherwise, Castor won't do business with us!
>
> Start by offering him *66*. While on the `sylvanly-narrower-oxboy` branch, set a variable in `ENCOM/convince_castor.sh`) to 66, create a pull request, and see what he tells you to do.
