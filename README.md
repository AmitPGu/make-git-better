## Directions

- Have fun :)
- Don't look at any hidden files or directories in this repo (unless you're directed to do so). **Specifically, don't look at the `.travis` or `.management` directories or the `.travis.yml` file. THIS WILL RUIN THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU.**
- This challenge will not require brute-forcing to solve - the solution, once you got it, should be clear.
- You are encourged to use any tool to solve the challenge. However, CLI is preferred to make sure you understand all the commands - save the GUI for day-to-day work.

## Reference materials
  
For how to use a specific command you always have `git help`. For a good explanation of concepts, [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the place to go.

### Stage 9

**For this stage, you must run the script `setup_stage_9.sh` first!**

You need to add more than 100 files into the `add_files_here` directory, and you can't do it in more than 3 commits. Shouldn't be too hard, should it?

Hint: Here's a quick shell script to create a lot of files in a directory.

```sh
for x in {4..105} ; do touch somenewfile$x ; done
```

And a CMD version:

```batch
for /l %a in (1 1 10) do type nul > "%a.txt"
```
