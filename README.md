## Directions

- Have fun :)
- Don't look at any hidden files or directories in this repo (unless you're directed to do so). **Specifically, don't look at the `.travis` or `.management` directories or the `.travis.yml` file. THIS WILL RUIN THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU.**
- This challenge will not require brute-forcing to solve - the solution, once you got it, should be clear.
- You are encourged to use any tool to solve the challenge. However, CLI is preferred to make sure you understand all the commands - save the GUI for day-to-day work.

## Reference materials
  
For how to use a specific command you always have `git help`. For a good explanation of concepts, [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the place to go.

## Stages

### Stage 1

ðŸš©

### Stage 2

This stage is just a warm-up and it shouldn't be confusing, difficult, or require any sort of special insight or research. This is basically a test to make sure all your setup is OK. Good luck! ðŸ‘‹

Your challange is:

1. Add 2 files to the root of the repo: `alice.txt` and `bob.txt`.
2. Commit your changes (should be only one commit!).
3. Push your changes to *your* remote repo.
4. Create a pull request from `your_user/make-git-better/start-here` to `ShayNehmad/make-git-better/start-here` on GitHub. [Click on this link for a guide to creating a Pull Request from your fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
5. Go get your flag from TravisCI, which will test your branch for you. TravisCI will give you the flag in the build job log (or tell you why you aren't getting the flag). To get to the job logs:
    1. Open the Pull Request page on `github.com`.
    2. Go to the "Checks" tab.
    3. Look for the TravisCI build, and click on `The build`, which will redirect you to `travis-ci.com`.
    4. Look at the Job Log.

#### What if I f-ed it up

Good! That's a good way to learn. You'll need to figure out how to return things to their original state and start over :)
