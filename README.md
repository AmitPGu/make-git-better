## Directions

- Have fun :)
- Don't look at any hidden files or directories in this repo (unless you're directed to do so). **Specifically, don't look at the `.travis` or `.management` directories or the `.travis.yml` file. THIS WILL RUIN THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU.**
- This challenge will not require brute-forcing to solve - the solution, once you got it, should be clear.
- You are encourged to use any tool to solve the challenge. However, CLI is preferred to make sure you understand all the commands - save the GUI for day-to-day work.

## Reference materials
  
For how to use a specific command you always have `git help`. For a good explanation of concepts, [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the place to go.

> Hello, Sam Flynn. I need to you get into _the Grid_; I need you to do it so you can get me OUT of _the Grid_. It's a long story, and we'll have to talk more later. Right now, **you have to trust me**. ENCOM (the bad guys ðŸ‘¿) locked me inside _the Grid_, and you have to find the key to get me out.
>
> For now, I've granted you access to ENCOM's basic login script. It's located at `ENCOM/login.py`. Try to run it and see what happens. If that doesn't work, try to read it so you can figure out what you can do.

NOTE: _To solve this you need to use only git commands and GitHub pull requests. You can read the login script, but don't edit stuff manually._
