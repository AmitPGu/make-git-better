## Directions

- Have fun :)
- Don't look at any hidden files or directories in this repo (unless you're directed to do so). **Specifically, don't look at the `.travis` or `.management` directories or the `.travis.yml` file. THIS WILL RUIN THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU.**
- This challenge will not require brute-forcing to solve - the solution, once you got it, should be clear.
- You are encourged to use any tool to solve the challenge. However, CLI is preferred to make sure you understand all the commands - save the GUI for day-to-day work.

## Reference materials
  
For how to use a specific command you always have `git help`. For a good explanation of concepts, [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the place to go.

> Hello, Sam Flynn. I need to you get into _the Grid_; I need you to do it to get me OUT of the Grid. It's a long story, and we'll have to talk more later. Right now, you have to trust me. ENCOM (the bad guys) locked me inside the Grid, and you'll have to find the key to get me out.
>
> For now, I've granted you access to ENCOM's basic login script. It's `ENCOM/login.py`.
>
> Try to run it and see what happens. If that doesn't work, read it to figure out what to do!

NOTE: _Remember, to solve this you need to use only git commands, don't edit scripts manually._
