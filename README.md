## Directions

- Have fun :)
- Don't look at any hidden files or directories in this repo (unless you're directed to do so). **Specifically, don't look at the `.travis` or `.management` directories or the `.travis.yml` file. THIS WILL RUIN THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU.**
- This challenge will not require brute-forcing to solve - the solution, once you got it, should be clear.
- You are encourged to use any tool to solve the challenge. However, CLI is preferred to make sure you understand all the commands - save the GUI for day-to-day work.

## Reference materials
  
For how to use a specific command you always have `git help`. For a good explanation of concepts, [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the place to go.

## Stages

### Stage 1

ðŸš©

### Stage 2

Your challange:

1. Add 2 files to the root of the repo: `alice.txt` and `bob.txt`.
2. Commit your changes (should be only one commit!)
3. Push your changes to your remote repo.
4. Create a pull request from your_repo/start-here to ShayNehmad/start-here.
5. Go get your flag from TravisCI, which will test your branch for you.

#### What if I f-ed it up

Good! That's a good way to learn. You'll need to figure out how to return things to their original state and start over :)
