Problems:
* Don't know how to get to the TravisCI build logs - give instructions
* If the original repo is changed the forks that are midway are basically f-ed (branch games won't work). So need
a nuclear option for re-creating the fork (delete all local branches, checkout `start-here`? or delete f-ed branches 
and recheckout the current stage. Can add a `local_stage` file under management which might even help for other things)
 * git remote -v
 * git remote add https://github.com/ShayNehmad/make-git-better upstream
 * git fetch upstream 
 * delete f-ed local branches 
 * git checkout -b f-ed-branch upstream/f-ed-branch
* Which branch to create a pull request to? Make it clearer. Should be the same stage probably.
